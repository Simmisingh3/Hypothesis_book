# Hypothesis Testing
In statistics, various tests are used to compare different samples or groups and draw conclusions about populations. These tests, known as statistical tests, focus on analyzing the likelihood or probability of obtaining the observed data under specific assumptions or hypotheses. They provide a framework for assessing evidence in support of or against a particular hypothesis.

A statistical test begins by formulating a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (Ha). The null hypothesis represents the default assumption, typically stating no effect or no difference, while the alternative hypothesis suggests a specific relationship or effect.

Different statistical test methods are available to calculate the probability, typically measured as a p-value, of obtaining the observed data. The p-value indicates the likelihood of observing the data or more extreme results assuming the null hypothesis is true. Researchers compare the calculated p-value to a predetermined significance level, often denoted as α, to make a decision regarding the null hypothesis. If the p-value is smaller than α, the results are considered statistically significant, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

# Example - Election Poll

Suppose elections are occuring in the state of Karnataka and there are two opposition parties and the whole state is voting. Suppose the population of karnataka is 1.4 crore and we want to get the inference about which party is gonna win before the vote counting is done. Here, we can perform statistical analysis in order to understand which party is gonna win.
We will select small part of that population that is the sample and perform hypothesis test and based on the test results we will predict about which party's gonna win.

There are different-different statistical tests like 
1. Z-test
2. T-tests
3. Chi-squared tests
4. ANOVA(F test) etc.
which are used to compute the **p-value**. Based on p-value(probability) value we decide either to reject or fail to reject a hypothesis.

### Numerical Variables
A numerical variable is a data variable that can take on any value within a finite or infinite interval. 

Numerical variables are also known as: Continuous variables, Quantitative variables.
Numerical variables have values that describe a measurable quantity as a number, like "how many" or "how much". 
Examples of numerical variables include: 
Length, Test scores, Height, Weight, Temperature, Blood glucose, SAT scores. 

Numerical variables can be either continuous or discrete. Continuous data can be thought of as being uncountably infinite. For example, you might pump 8.40 gallons, or 8.41, or 8.414863 gallons, or any possible number from 0 to 20. 

### Categorical Variables
Categorical variables belong to a subset of variables that can be divided into discrete categories. Names or labels are the most common categories. These variables are also known as qualitative variables because they depict the variable's quality or characteristics.

Categorical variables can be divided into two categories:

**Nominal Variable**: A nominal variable's categories have no natural ordering. Example: Gender, Blood groups
**Ordinal Variable**: A variable that allows the categories to be sorted is ordinal variables. Customer satisfaction (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Average, Bad, and so on) is an example.

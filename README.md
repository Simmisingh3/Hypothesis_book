# Hypothesis Testing
In statistics, various tests are used to compare different samples or groups and draw conclusions about populations. These tests, known as statistical tests, focus on analyzing the likelihood or probability of obtaining the observed data under specific assumptions or hypotheses. They provide a framework for assessing evidence in support of or against a particular hypothesis.

A statistical test begins by formulating a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (Ha). The null hypothesis represents the default assumption, typically stating no effect or no difference, while the alternative hypothesis suggests a specific relationship or effect.

Different statistical test methods are available to calculate the probability, typically measured as a p-value, of obtaining the observed data. The p-value indicates the likelihood of observing the data or more extreme results assuming the null hypothesis is true. Researchers compare the calculated p-value to a predetermined significance level, often denoted as α, to make a decision regarding the null hypothesis. If the p-value is smaller than α, the results are considered statistically significant, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

There are different-different statistical tests like Z-test, T-tests, Chi-squared tests, ANOVA(F test) etc. which are used to compute the p-value. In this article, we will learn about the T-test.


### What Are Categorical Variables?
Categorical variables belong to a subset of variables that can be divided into discrete categories. Names or labels are the most common categories. These variables are also known as qualitative variables because they depict the variable's quality or characteristics.

Categorical variables can be divided into two categories:

**Nominal Variable**: A nominal variable's categories have no natural ordering. Example: Gender, Blood groups
**Ordinal Variable**: A variable that allows the categories to be sorted is ordinal variables. Customer satisfaction (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Average, Bad, and so on) is an example
